# Task 3 – Stored Procedures for Inventory Management

##  What I Built

I created stored procedures to automate common inventory operations, such as updating stock and adding new products. These procedures make it easier to manage inventory with a single command instead of writing long SQL queries every time.

##  Why I Built It

* To **practice backend automation** using SQL.
* To reduce errors and save time while performing repeated inventory tasks.
* To understand how **IN** and **OUT** parameters work in stored procedures.

##  How I Built It

1. Created a sample `Products` table with product details and stock quantities.
2. Wrote stored procedures for inventory tasks:

   * `UpdateStock` → Updates stock quantity for a given product.
   * `AddProduct` → Adds a new product to the inventory.
3. Tested the procedures with sample execution commands using `CALL`.
4. Verified results by selecting from the `Products` table.

##  Outcome

By completing this task, I gained hands-on experience in **backend SQL automation** using stored procedures, which will help me in real-world database management scenarios.
